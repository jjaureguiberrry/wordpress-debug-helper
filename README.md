# Wordpress Debug Helper

This code is intended to be used as a mu-plugin (Must Use Plugin). 
Due to security reasons, it is recommended to uninstall the plugin when it is not used.

# Features

  - Print and log debug data in production environment without affecting end user experience.
  - Search string through project files when no SSH access is available.


# Usage
Use the following actions in your code where you want to add the debug trace:
**Log data to *my-errors.log* file**
```php
do_action('debugger_write_log', $message, $identifier, $print_stack);
```
**Print recursive data into screen**
This feature will work only if the query parameter **debug_mode** is present and set to **true**.
```php
do_action('debugger_var_dump', $message, $identifier, $print_stack, $die);
```
**In order to Search string in project files you need to add the following parameter to the URL:**
`search_in_folder={folder_name}|{needle}|{mode}`
